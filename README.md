It shits itself every 3 minutes 

# Known issues 
- When downloading from uv/search engine, the topbar gets broken 

# Features 
- DNF support (kinda)   
- UV 3 w/ adblock   
- Downloading apps   
- A package manager   
- A rootfs
- A file system (but the wrappers sometimes kill themselves)   
- A javascript terminal (regular one coming soon i promise, once i sort out /bin/sh/dnf and.. the rest of the stuff that goes in /bin/sh)


# TODO
- Sandbox the terminal   
- Make js terminal only availible in developer mode    
- Make developer mode     
- Make OOBE CSS
- Make apps use a database instead of being hardcoded   
- Finish the shell and finish all javascript things that go in /bin/sh   
- Make the filesystem editable to the end user without developer mode (but make it use the fs wrapper & limit rootfs editing)     
- Add a /uv directory in /sys (/sys/uv/) for uv configs and user settings 
- Make system flags do something
